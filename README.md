## Payment Methods

### 1. Direct Crypto Payment

**How It Works:**
1. User selects a plan
2. System generates a temporary wallet address
3. User sends BEP20 USDT (BSC network) to temporary wallet
4. System automatically verifies payment on blockchain
5. Payment is split automatically:
   - **50%** to Admin wallet
   - **50%** to Referrer wallet (if user was referred)
6. Plan is activated immediately after confirmation

**Payment Details:**
- Network: BSC (Binance Smart Chain)
- Token: USDT (BEP20)
- Confirmation Time: 1-2 minutes
- Payment Expiry: 10 minutes

**Process Flow:**
```
User → Temporary Wallet → [Auto Split] → Admin (50%) + Referrer (50%)
                                      ↓
                               Plan Activated
```

### 2. Wallet Payment

**How It Works:**
1. User must have sufficient USDT in their wallet
2. System checks on-chain balance
3. If insufficient BNB for gas fees:
   - System automatically funds 0.0001 BNB from admin wallet
   - Waits for confirmation
4. Transfers USDT from user's wallet:
   - To admin wallet (50% or 100%)
   - To referrer wallet (50% if applicable)
5. Plan activated immediately

**Requirements:**
- Sufficient USDT balance in wallet
- BSC network
- BNB for gas (auto-funded if needed)

**Advantages:**
- Use referral earnings to purchase plans
- Instant activation
- No need to send from external wallet

---

## Referral System
### Commission Structure

**Commission Rate: 50%**

When someone purchases a plan using your referral link:
- **You receive:** 50% of the purchase price
- **Admin receives:** 50% of the purchase price

### Referral Link Format

```
https://stormeye.app?ref=YOUR_USERNAME
```

**Example:**
```
https://stormeye.app?ref=john_doe
```

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Share Your Link
- Get your unique referral link from the Referral section
- Share on social media, blogs, forums, or directly with friends

#### Step 2: User Signs Up
- New user clicks your referral link
- Referral code is stored in their browser
- Works even if they sign up later

#### Step 3: User Purchases
- Referred user purchases any paid plan
- System automatically calculates 50% commission

#### Step 4: Instant Payout
- Commission goes directly to your crypto wallet
- No waiting period
- No approval needed
- Visible in wallet instantly

### Earnings Examples

| Plan Purchased | Price | Your Commission (50%) |
|----------------|-------|-----------------------|
| Egg | $6 | **$3** |
| Zerger | $15 | **$7.50** |
| Protossi | $24 | **$12** |
| Terranium | $36 | **$18** |

}
```

Backend Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "isNewUser": true/false,
  "user": {
    "username": "freelancer_username",
    "currentPlan": "egg",

JWT tokens generated:
- Access Token (1 hour expiry)
- Refresh Token (30 days expiry)

#### 3. **Extension-Sale Site Sync**

**Sync Process:**
```
Extension → Sale Site: Check if user logged in
Sale Site → Backend: GET /api/extension/check_auth (with JWT)
Backend → Extension: Returns logged_in status and username

If logged in:
  Extension → Backend: POST /api/extension/sync
  {
    "freelancer_username": "john_doe"
  }
  Backend links: freelancer_username ↔ user_email
  
Extension → Backend: GET /api/extension/plan_info (with JWT)
Backend returns:
  {
    "plan_type": "egg",
    "plan_expire_date": timestamp,
    "plan_start_date": timestamp,
    "status": "Active"
  }
```

#### 4. **Plan Synchronization**

**Scenarios:**

```

### Extension Start Tracking

**Purpose:** Track when users start using the extension

**Process:**
1. Extension calls `/api/extension/register_start` on first launch
2. Backend stores `start_timestamp` (milliseconds)
3. Timestamp persists across sessions
4. Used for analytics and trial management

### Workflow 4: Using Referral Earnings to Buy Plans

```
1. Earned $15 from referrals
   ↓
2. Wallet shows: $15 available
   ↓
3. Current plan expires in 2 days
   ↓
4. Go to Pricing page
   ↓
5. Select Zerger plan ($15 for 3 months)
   ↓
6. Click "Purchase"
   ↓
7. Choose "Pay with Wallet"
   ↓
8. System checks balance: $15 available ✓
   ↓
9. System executes transfer:
   - Check BNB for gas
   - If low → Auto-fund from admin wallet
   - Transfer $15 to admin wallet
   - No referrer split (your own purchase)
   ↓
10. Plan activated immediately
    ↓
11. Extension syncs automatically
    ↓
12. New plan active: Zerger (3 months)
    ↓
13. Wallet balance: $0
    ↓
14. Continue bidding with new plan!
```

### Workflow 5: Failed Referrer Payment Scenario

```
1. Your referral purchases Terranium ($36)
   ↓
2. System attempts split:
   - Admin transfer: $18 → SUCCESS ✓
   - Referrer transfer: $18 → FAILED ✗
   ↓
3. Purchase still completes:
   - User's plan activated
   - Admin received payment
   ↓
4. System logs failed referrer transfer:
   - Referrer wallet address
   - Amount: $18
   - Admin TX hash (for reference)
   - Error message
   ↓
5. Your earnings recorded as "pending":
   - Shows in dashboard
   - Status: Pending manual payout
   ↓
6. Admin reviews failed transfers daily
   ↓
7. Manual payout processed within 24 hours:
   - Admin sends $18 directly to your wallet
   - Transaction hash recorded
   - Status updated to "confirmed"
   ↓
8. Email notification sent
   ↓
9. Balance available for withdrawal
```

## Best Practices

### For Users

#### Setting Up Extension
1. **Start with conservative filters**: Don't block too many countries initially
2. **Test proposal templates**: Create multiple variants and test which works best
3. **Monitor bid logs**: Check which projects you're winning
4. **Adjust budgets**: Update based on your win rate
5. **Use AI wisely**: Custom AI can be expensive, template works for most cases

#### Managing Referrals
1. **Share strategically**: Target freelancer communities and forums
2. **Create content**: Write blog posts or YouTube videos about the tool
3. **Track performance**: Monitor which channels bring most referrals
4. **Withdraw regularly**: Don't let earnings sit idle
5. **Reinvest earnings**: Use to extend your own subscription

#### Wallet Security
1. **Backup wallet**: Save your wallet address safely
2. **Never share private key**: System handles everything
3. **Verify addresses**: Double-check before withdrawing
4. **Use correct network**: Always BSC for USDT
5. **Keep small amounts**: Withdraw larger earnings regularly

### For Administrators

#### Payment Processing
1. **Monitor temporary wallets**: Check for stuck payments
2. **Handle failed referrer transfers**: Process manually within 24 hours
3. **Monitor gas prices**: Adjust gas funding amounts if BSC fees spike
4. **Verify blockchain transactions**: Always confirm on BSCScan
5. **Keep admin wallet funded**: Ensure enough BNB for gas funding

#### User Support
1. **Email verification issues**: Check spam folders, resend if needed
2. **Payment not confirmed**: Check blockchain explorer, may need more confirmations
3. **Wrong network deposits**: Educate users about BEP20 on BSC only
4. **Extension not syncing**: Verify JWT tokens, check CORS settings
5. **Referral not credited**: Check referral collection in database
